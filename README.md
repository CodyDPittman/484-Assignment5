This project expanded on a previous image processing project in Qt Creator using C++. The project allowed for the selection of a JPEG image to be uploaded to a FPGA board via UDP connection which then could be manipulated/have images overlain using a Python script. The values sent to the Python script where sent via UDP connection and a GUI slider.
